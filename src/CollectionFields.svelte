                    <li>To ensure the safety and security of your NFTs, it is important to store them responsibly. One option is to use a hardware wallet.</li>
                    <li>Never share your private keys with anyone, as this can lead to loss of access or scamming.</li>
                    <li>Hold onto your NFTs for a longer period of time, as their value is likely to increase due to scarcity. Avoid the temptation to sell them for a quick profit.</li>
                    <li>If you come across a collection that you think may be linked to this project, verify it on this website. All of the available collections are listed below.</li>
                    <li>Please note that I am not a financial advisor and it is important to do your own research before buying NFTs and understanding the potential risks involved.</li>
